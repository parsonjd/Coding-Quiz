Coding-Quiz

The Coding-Quiz is a 60 second timed quiz with five multiple choice questions.  If a question is answered incorrectly, a 15 second penalty will be deducted from your time.  The quiz will be over once all five questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0. 

Upon completion, a score will be generated and will ask for the user's initials.  The user's initials and score will be added to the highscore page and will be displayed if it is one of the top five highest scores. 

The webpage is easy to use and is responsive to all screen sizes.
